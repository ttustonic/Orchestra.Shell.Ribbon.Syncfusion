# Orchestra.Shell.Ribbon.Syncfusion
This is the Orchestra (https://github.com/WildGums/Orchestra) shell with Syncfusion Ribbon.

Needs some work with themes. Themes work (mostly) like themes in the Orchestra Fluent ribbon, which is not compatible with the theming in Syncfusion.

Syncfusion controls work for 30 days with a trial license. After that they need a license. There is a free Community license, which can be obtained from the Visual Studio marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SyncfusionInc.SyncfusionCommunityLicense)
